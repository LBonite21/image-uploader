This exercise took me approximately 5 hours to complete. With the time given and the scope of the task, I was able to finish the core features and Iâ€™m proud of the result. If I had more time, I would integrate a database to persist images and metadata, expose robust GET/POST endpoints for querying and uploading images, and add drag-and-drop support for image files to improve the upload experience.
